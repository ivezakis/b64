# b64

I got tired of looking up commands or visiting a specific website every time I needed to encode or decode a base64 string. 
I also didn't want to have to save the strings to a file and then output a new one every time.

This utility provides a simple one-liner to easily encode/decode base64.

Usage:
```shell
b64 <encode|decode> <input>
```
